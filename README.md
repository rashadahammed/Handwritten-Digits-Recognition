# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

In the Handwritten Digits Recognition project, I delved into the MNIST dataset, a cornerstone in computer vision, to develop and refine models for classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The project involved a thorough analysis of the dataset, followed by the development of classification models using algorithms like SVM and K-nearest neighbors. I evaluated various models to identify the most effective one for accurately recognizing digits, and compiled a detailed report on their performance. This analysis not only highlighted the best-performing classifier but also provided insights into practical applications, such as automated digit recognition systems used in document processing and optical character recognition (OCR). Challenges encountered during the project were documented, along with the techniques employed to overcome them. The entire process and findings were presented in a single Jupyter notebook, demonstrating a comprehensive and practical approach to solving real-world digit recognition problems.
